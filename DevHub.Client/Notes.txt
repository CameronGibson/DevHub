NOTES:

After I have a user table and my back and front end talking, I can possibly implement OAuth 2. which
I can do with Spring Security.

Got User data connected to the server now. Not using it yet.

TODO:

Figure out how to add images to my database(PAIN IN MY ASS/ something to do with SQL permissions).

issues with http.post request might have something to do with my
ssms permissions.

I'm 99% sure my POST request is making it to my server but Spring JPA is not handling the data how it is intended to.

Add more products to the database. build out some more pages.

implement a songs library, maybe see if i can integrate with sound cloud or just have mp3 files
