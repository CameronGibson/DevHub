NOTES:

Server side error 500, nvarchar is incompatible with type image

Server side is not passing back images, just image urls.

Auto increment is not working when passing back items from the client side.

After I have a user table and my back and front end talking, I can possibly implement OAuth 2. which
I can do with Spring Security.

Got User data connected to the server now. Not using it yet. 

TODO:

Figure out how to add images to my database(PAIN IN MY ASS/ something to do with SQL permissions).

implement a songs library, maybe see if i can integrate with sound cloud or just have mp3 files

build out more pages.
