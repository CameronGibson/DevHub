NOTES:

Auto increment is not working when passing back items from the client side.

After I have a user table and my back and front end talking, I can possibly implement OAuth 2. maybe Okta

Got User data connected to the server now. Not using it yet. 

TODO:

Figure out how to add images to my database.

implement a songs library, maybe see if i can integrate with sound cloud or just have mp3 files

build out more pages.





Images not displaying properly. Now im storing the last file extension in the database and 
building the path in the ngOnInit function while elements are loaded in.

Then I display the image in html with the [src]="product.modelImage".

This is still causing errors.

Known issues: 
    -any null path throws errors for cannot find.
    -same thing happens even when there is a non null path.
    -database not storing author name...
