This is a personal project of mine that I have been building to demonstrate my ever-growing knowledge of full-stack programming.

This web based application is written with multiple languages such as C#, TypeScript, SCSS and HTML.

The aim of this application is to demonstate the author's knowledge of full-stack application development(HTTP protocol, RESTful API's) and more.

What does this application do and what is it for?

This application can be summed up as a platform in which independant video game developers can come and buy or sell the content they have
created. These products and services include Soundtracks, SFX, 3D Models and more.
