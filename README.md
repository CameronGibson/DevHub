This is a personal project of mine that I have been building to demonstrate my ever-growing knowledge of full-stack programming.

This web based application is written with multiple languages such as Java, TypeScript, SCSS and HTML and some XML which is mostly Spring Boot generated.

The aim of this application is to demonstate the author's knowledge of full-stack application development(HTTP protocol, RESTful API's) and more.


What does this application do and what is it for?

This application can be summed up as a platform in which independant video game developers can come and buy or sell the content they have
created. These products and services include Soundtracks, SFX, 3D Models and more.
